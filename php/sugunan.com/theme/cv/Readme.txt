Hi there!
 
John Smith is a one-page CV/Portfolio website template. It’s built to tell a story about a professional designer/web developer to a possible employer or a hirer.  
 
In this package you will find three sub-directories:
1. Design. Includes layered photoshop files.
2. HTML. Includes three predefined website packages.
3. Docs. Instructions and descriptions.
 
Please feel free to ask me any question regarding installation and customization of the template via http://themeforest.net/user/odincov.
 
Thanks for purchasing!
